# Tracking Reentry Ballistic Targets using Acceleration and Jerk Models
Note: This is a freelance endeavor accomplished based on a research paper

The acceleration model and a jerk model are modelled using MATLAB and Simulink for estimation of the kinematic state of reentry ballistic targets (RBTs) using extended Kalman filters (EKF)

Here's the output of the Simulink MBD compared with the actual results.
