# Tracking Reentry Ballistic Targets using Acceleration and Jerk Models
Note: This is a freelance endeavor accomplished based on a research paper

The acceleration model and a jerk model are modelled using MATLAB and Simulink for estimation of the kinematic state of reentry ballistic targets (RBTs) using extended Kalman filters (EKF)
